<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
<li>3 chicken breasts</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>1 cup Broccoli, diced</li>
<li>16oz of Schar Penne</li>
<li>1/4 cup Glutino Gluten Free Breadcrumbs</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cheese Sauce:</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 cups milk</li>
<li>1 tbsp corn starch</li>
<li>2 tbsp butter</li>
<li>2 cups of Colby cheese</li>
<li>2 cups of Sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>Paprika</li>
</ul>

<h4>Directions:</h4>

<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</p>

<p>Cook pasta until al dente. Steam the broccoli. Once the broccoli is steamed, transfer it to a cutting board and dice.</p>

<p>After de-fatting the chicken, using a meat tenderizer, pound the chicken once or twice. Brush olive oil over chicken and then sprinkle with the garlic garlic; flip chicken and repeat. Place the chicken in a skillet over medium to medium-high heat and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Flip the chicken at least once in the skillet and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a cutting board and chop/dice the chicken.</p>

<p>Grease a 9×13 pan and spread out the cooked pasta. On top of the pasta, spread out the chicken and broccoli. Stir everything together.</p>

<p>Cheese Sauce: In a microwaveable bowl, combine the milk, cornstarch and butter and microwave 3 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add cheese and stir.  Microwave for another 2 minutes or until cheese is melted, stirring occasionally.  If the sauce is not cheesy enough, add more taste. Once the sauce is cheesy to taste, pour over the pasta mixture.  DO NOT STIR.</p>

<p>Sprinkle breadcrumbs over the cheese sauce.  Bake for 30-45 minutes.</p>
