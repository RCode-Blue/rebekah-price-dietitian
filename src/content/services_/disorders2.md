A food intolerance refers to a food component that triggers a symptom in the body. Unlike food allergies where the immune system is directly immediately activated (e.g. swelling of the lips or tongue), food intolerances often involve the indirect stimulation of the immune system via nerves in the gut after a food is eaten. These nerves can then signal different responses around the body. Or if the gut is in bad condition (e.g. highly inflamed), food components may enter the blood when otherwise wouldnâ€™t be able to, stimulating an immune response.

Together, we can take a look at your current diet and your symptoms to get a picture of whether food intolerances may be playing a role for you. There are a number of investigative elimination diets that you may be guided through, depending on your symptoms, to help identify which foods are problematic for you. Ultimately, I would like you to be able to broaden your diet again as much as possible, while managing how you feel.
