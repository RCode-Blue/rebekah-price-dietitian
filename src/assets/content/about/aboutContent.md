I am an Accredited Practising Dietitian and Accredited Nutritionist based in Sydney, and a lover of food. 

As a Dietitian and Nutritionist, I work with people who are looking to create sustainable long-term healthy lifestyle changes; effectively manage medical conditions; navigate IBS or food intolerance; and establish a healthy relationship with food.

I take pride in offering individualized support for every single client I see. I will listen to what you have been through, where you’re at now, and what advice and guidance you need to get where you’re going with your diet, eating and lifestyle habits.
