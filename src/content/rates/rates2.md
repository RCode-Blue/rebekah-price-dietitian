In your review consultation session we will monitor your progress and continue to provide you with practical advice and ongoing support. Changes may be made to your nutrition care plan to achieve your nutritional goals.  

Frequency of review consultations are determined on an individualised basis. It is recommended for ongoing appointments to be between 1 and 4 weeks apart.
