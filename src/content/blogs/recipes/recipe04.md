title: "Nut-Free Chocolate Protein Bar"
---
<p>You can’t go wrong with homemade protein bars, such as peanut butter protein bars and no bake protein bars. Chocolate protein bars are also on rotation, especially when the chocolate cravings strike! 

When I’m looking to make chocolate protein powder recipes, I always turn to these homemade bars. They are so much cheaper and tastier than packaged ones and use much better ingredients. I find myself feeling much more satisfied when enjoying a homemade version, and I love knowing EXACTLY what goes into them! 

Before a workout, after a workout, or when you what a high protein chocolate snack, you will love to have these on hand. </p>
