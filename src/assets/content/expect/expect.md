<h3>What to Expect</h3>

<p>My goals for you for each session are:<p>
<ul>
<li>helping you to address your health-focused goals </li>
<li>helping you to achieve optimal nutrition </li>
<li>helping you to achieve an understanding of how you can plan appropriate meals and snacks</li>
<li>helping you to achieve a healthy relationship with food </li>
</ul>
  
<p>
A dietitian consultation is very different from a consultation with your doctor. Your first consultation will be for 1 hour (or longer for some health conditions), so we have time to take a detailed look at your health issues and your current diet and lifestyle patterns. I will spend time asking you lots of questions to try to get a thorough history of your health, what you eat and what sort of factors affect your eating. You will be asked questions about your eating habits and food intake and perhaps about your digestion or any symptoms you may be experiencing.

<p>
Once I have the information I need, we can work together to come up with a nutrition plan to achieve your health goals.
