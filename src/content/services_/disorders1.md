The stomach is an important organ in the body. It plays a vital role in digestion of foods, releases various enzymes and also protects the lower intestine from harmful organisms. The stomach connects to the esophagus above and to the small intestine below. It is intricately related to the pancreas, spleen and liver.  

It is important to restore health to the digestive system to avoid long term nutritional deficiencies, foster a healthy gut microbiome and reduce systemic inflammation. Where necessary, we can utilize tests such as comprehensive stool analysis to check for a range of parasites as well as flora status and IgG / IgA food intolerance testing.  However, your symptoms are a great place to start and we can soon have your guts on their way to good health.
